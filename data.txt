1 myself How could you be seeing into my eyes like open doors? 
You led me down into my core where I've became so numb
Without a soul my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and led it back home 
You woke me up inside 
Called my name and saved me from the dark 
You have bidden my blood and it ran 
Before I would become undone 
You saved me from the nothing I've almost become 
You were bringing me to life 
Now that I knew what I'm without 
You can've just left me describing 
You breathed into me and made me real 
Frozen inside without your touch 
Without your love, darling 
Only you are the life among the dead 
I've been living a lie, there's nothing inside 
You were bringing me to lifeo life
